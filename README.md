# SETI Signal Classification
SETI is an acronym for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. It is an effort to detect evidence of
technological civilizations that may exist elsewhere in the universe. 7 type of SETI signals are present in the dataset:
+ brightpixel
+ narrowband
+ narrowbanddrd
+ noise
+ squarepulsednarrowband
+ squiggle
+ squigglesquarepulsednarrowband

Our objective is to differenciate those signals properly.
[Dataset can be found here.]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tentotheminus9/seti-data?datasetId=57000) This dataset is a smaller version of [Machine Learning for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Hackathon & Code Challenge](https://www.seti.org/machine-learning-search-extraterrestrial-intelligence-hackathon-code-challenge) dataset.
